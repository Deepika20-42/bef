Taj Mahal and Agra Fort are located in the ancient city of Agra in UttarPradesh, India. With the construction of Taj Express way, it has become an easy drive from Delhi. Situated at a distance of about 230 kms from Delhi, it takes about 3 hrs to reach Agra
Taking advantage of a long weekend, we left Delhi at around 7.00 AM for Agra for an overnight trip. En route we stopped at eatery joints all built in a huge complex – there are variety of o ptions such as Indian food at Bikano, Pizza at Dominoes, Indian food at Dhabha, continental at Starbucks or Subway. We took an hour break and then embarked on the journey again. The road is fantastic and it really gives a thrill to hit the paddle at 130 km/hr.We reached Agra, Radisson Blu at around 1.00 PM and quickly checked into our rooms. There are lot of stay options available in this tourist centric city – there are homestays, hotels as well as UP tourism guest house.
Taj entrance is just walkable distance from the hotel (about 1.4 Kms). We decided to walk down the road, although there are other options such as auto rikshaw, pedicabs and good old horse cart or Tonga.Tonga is a very old way of transportation – used since time immemorial but very few places in India now offers this mode of transportation. Agra, Hyderabad, Amritsar are few of the old cities which offer this opportunity to experience riding a horse cart.
The entire stretch of 1.4 km is laid in red sandstone is so very typical of Agra and there are shops all along the way upto the ticket counter. Shops sell marble souvenirs, leather chappals or footwear, typical local embroidered kurtis – in a nutshell lot of things you can pick up from. The city is also famous for petha, an indian delicacy, a must try for the sweet tooth.

>Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas.  <cite> </cite>
Built in 1573, it took more than 4000 workers and eight years to complete the Agra fort. The fort remained as the main residence of the emperors belonging to the Mughal dynasty until the year 1638.

The fort houses numerous impressive structures like the Jahangir Mahal, Khas Mahal, Diwan-i-Khass, Diwan-i-Am, Machchhi Bhawan and Moti Masjid. The fort is situated at a distance of about 2.5 kilometers from Taj Mahal.
In 1638, the Mughals moved their capital from Agra to Delhi, causing the Agra Fort to lose its status as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Often described as the walled city, Agra Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, the fort is a major tourist spot and attracts many tourists from all over the world.
History of the Fort (as sourced from Wikipedia, culturalIndia and as verified by the guide)

Agra Fort is known for its rich history. The fort has been owned by many emperors and rulers in the past, undergoing many changes in its appearance.

It all began in the year 1526 when the first battle of Panipat was fought between Babur and Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty. When Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi, he made the fort as his home. He then modified the fort . Babur’s successor, Humayun’s coronation took place at the fort in the year 1530.

In 1540, Sher Shah Suri of the Sur Empire waged a war against Humayun and defeated him at Bilgram. Sher Shah Suri took over the ownership of the fort from Humayun and made minor changes to it, so as to suit his own architectural taste. The fort stayed with the emperors of the Sur dynasty for the next 15 years. In 1555, Humayun managed to recapture Agra and with it the fort as well. But a year later, Hemu, the general and military commander of Adil Shah Suri (final emperor of the Sur dynasty) captured Agra and declared himself as king. Barely a month into the kingship of Hemu, Akbar, along with his army, marched into Delhi and defeated the forces of Hemu. The fort once again belonged to the Mughals, but was fast disintegrating. Back then, it was known as Badalgarh and was built with bricks alone. Realizing its historical and situational significance, Akbar decided to rebuild it with red sandstone.

During the reign of Shah Jahan, the fort was modified considerably and took the current form. Shah Jahan destroyed some of the edifices within the fort and rebuilt it as per his own architectural taste. During the early 17th century, the fort was captured by the Maratha Empire.During this period, the fort saw many owners including various Maratha emperors and their enemies which included a host of Mughal emperors. In 1761, the Marathas underwent a massive defeat at the hands of Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Durrani Empire. The emperors of the Durrani dynasty made the fort their home until 1785. In 1785, the fort was regained by the Marathas under the reign of Mahadji Shinde. The Marathas then lost their battle against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War and with it the fort. The British then enjoyed the comfort of the fort until it was handed over to the government of India in 1947.

Layout and Architecture:

The 380,000-square-metre (94-acre or a stretch of 2.5 km ) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river and its walls are seventy feet high. The walls of the fort are a massive seventy feet high. The fort, when viewed from above, has a semicircular shape. The base of the fort faces the bank of the river Yamuna.

It has four gates (one on each side). Out of the four gates, the Delhi gate and Lahore gate are the most prominent ones. The Lahore gate was later renamed as Amar Singh Gate. Akbar used the Delhi gate as his main entrance and the gate also served as a security against the invaders. There is also an inner gateway known as the Elephant Gate.
