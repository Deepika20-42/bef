> “Life is more ups and downs,
                              Than in flats.   
      Life is more in mountains,
                        Than in plateau. 
      Life I more in Manali,
                         Than in Delhi.
    Some conversations are like the Manali nights 
        Cold to the body but warm to the soul.” <cite> </cite>
