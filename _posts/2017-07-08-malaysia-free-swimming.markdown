Comprising of 26 natural atolls, Maldives has channels of dual islands with a beautiful scenic backdrop and beautiful palm trees. Encircled by lagoons blessed with crystal clear waters, Maldives is an unusual holiday destination with a lot of beautiful accommodation options from plush resorts to beautiful guesthouses, the Maldives has just the perfect setting for honeymooners and couples. Offering much more than the sand, the sun and the water Maldives is also about the rich culture and heritage. One can explore the island villages, heritage sites, and local handicrafts while experiencing the serenity of the island.

I don’t think anywhere quite compares with the sheer beauty of Maldives. The abundance of atolls jutting out of deep blue waters is overwhelming. While flying in from Male, we saw on paradise after another. The islands are so small, they have to build bungalows over the water. And the water is so shallow, that the resorts stand high amidst the shallow waters. These islands are sitting on underwater plateaus and felt like they were just waiting for us to come and expereince the charm.

Moreover, we wanted a relaxing trip where we can just sit around the beach on an isolated island and sip in our cocktails. Also, we wanted to experience the stay in a water villa. From the hospitality of the Adaaran Resort to our stay, everything was astounding. We were excellently served and assisted by the staff. Here is what all made our Maldives travel experience even better.
