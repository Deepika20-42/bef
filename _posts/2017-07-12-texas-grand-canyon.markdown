The one night tour is for people who have a limited amount of time to see the desert and, in most cases, you’ll visit the sand dunes in Zagora. These dunes are much smaller and less impressive than Erg Chebbi, but a great option if you only have one night to spare.
The two night tour takes you to the Erg Chebbi dunes — the amazing ones I showcased in my photo essay from my trip.
The three night tour takes you to both Zagora and Erg Chebbi, and, well, I didn’t see too much point in spending a day going to the smaller dunes when I could see the more impressive ones!What I naively didn’t realise when I booked this tour was that the Sahara Desert is really far away.
Like, two days of driving far away.
Fortunately, there were plenty of fascinating stops to make along the way, all of which helped us to gain a small insight into Berber culture.
First on the list was Ait Benhaddou, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s a traditional mud-brick city in the high Atlas Mountains that has been featured in so many famous movies. Most notably, it set the scene for both Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.
Fortunately for us, we had much of the village to ourselves and we able to wander around its alleyways without much disturbance from our tourists or touts.
After a very long and very tiring day of over 10 hours of driving we finally reached our hotel for the night, where I nearly passed out at the excitement of having wifi in the almost-desert.

And then I actually passed out from exhaustion.

The second day began at a horrifically early hour but today, I wasn’t complaining.

Today, I was finally going to see the Sahara Desert!

However, like the previous day, the journey wouldn’t be complete without visiting even more Berber villages. These ones were even more interesting — dry, dusty mountains, enormous gorges, spectacular waterfalls and lush green valleys, which looked wildly out of place in the middle of the desert.

  

> “Do not regret the passing of the camel and the caravan. The Sahara has changed, but it remains a desert without compromise, the world in its extreme. There is no place as dry and hot and hostile.” <cite> </cite>

Then, finally, we reached the start of the desert.

Over the next two hours, I watched the surrounding landscape get flatter and flatter, the rocks get smaller and smaller and the sand get more and more orange.

At 6pm, we arrived.

I was finally in the Sahara Desert and it was all I could do to keep from crying with happiness.
It was so magical. I’d never seen sand so orange, never seen so much sand before in my life. I loved it.

We were greeted by our Berber guides and taken over to meet our camels.

This was the moment I had been dreading.

Knowing the ridiculous things that always seem to happen to me, I knew that there was no way I’d be able to successfully ride a camel without having a near-death experience.
